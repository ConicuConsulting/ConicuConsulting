# Hi there, I'm Callum Maystone 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m an innovative Solution Architect and developer passionate about building intelligent systems that redefine how we understand and utilize data. My primary project, **Active Graph Networks (AGNs)**, is an advanced AI framework designed to revolutionize contextual understanding and data analysis across multiple industries. 🚀

## 🌐 About Me

I'm deeply committed to solving complex problems using technology, particularly in AI, cloud architecture, and structured data analysis. I’ve worked on diverse projects ranging from **trading bots** and **healthcare systems** to **legal analysis tools** and **defense applications**. 

I'm always open to connecting, learning, and collaborating on groundbreaking projects!

### 🔭 Current Project

### 🌟 **Active Graph Networks (AGNs)**

AGNs redefine how we approach AI by focusing on the **pre-definition of relationships** within data to establish meaningful insights in real-time. By leveraging a graph-based structure, AGNs dynamically update and adapt, allowing for the kind of deep contextual understanding that traditional models often miss.

AGNs have potential applications in:

- **Healthcare** 🏥: Integration with HL7/FHIR for patient records and decision support.
- **Finance** 💰: Real-time trading bots using predefined trading strategies.
- **Defense** 🛡️: Signals and intelligence analysis with dynamic decision matrices.
- **Legal and Governance** ⚖️: Contextual analysis tools for legal document interpretation.

## 🧰 My Technical Toolbox

Here's a quick look at the technologies I work with:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript (NodeJS, React), TypeScript
- **Cloud Platforms**: Azure, AWS, GCP
- **Databases**: Neo4j (Graph DB), SQL, Azure Blob
- **AI Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **APIs**: HL7, FHIR, FIX
- **Security Standards**: HTTPS, mTLS, IAM, TLS, and Encryption

## 💡 Vision and Goals

My goal with AGNs is to create a standardized AI framework that can be adopted across industries, setting the stage for **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** development by using structured relationship-driven analysis. I’m passionate about exploring and building new methodologies, and I’m dedicated to seeing AGNs become a recognized IEEE standard.

## 📈 Current Research and Projects

- **Automated Trading Bot**: Utilizing AGNs to create a dynamic trading system that adapts in real-time based on market sentiment and financial indicators.
- **YouMatter**: An Azure-based healthcare ecosystem designed to enhance patient care and streamline operations using advanced data analytics.
- **Legal Analysis AI**: Building tools for interpreting complex legal documents using graph-based reasoning and contextual analysis.

## 🌱 Learning and Development

I’m currently expanding my expertise in:

- Real-time systems architecture for scalable AI
- Advanced graph theory for data-driven insights
- Enterprise-level cloud security and compliance
