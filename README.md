# Callum Maystone – Ground Up Rebuild (v2025.04.15)

> "To remember is to structure. To structure is to reclaim the self."

## 🧭 Purpose

This is not a repository of code.  
This is a **relational memory system** — a **living journal of thought**, stitched together to:

- Capture my raw cognition
- Reconstruct memory from data
- Track internal evolution
- Detect anomalies in my perception
- Protect and deidentify sensitive context

## 🎯 Core Intent

1. **Craft instructions and intent** — explicitly declare what each component is for and why it exists.
2. **Maintain a living mental map** — every file, function, or insight is a node in a reconstructable self.
3. **Thread memory** — version every breakthrough, collapse every insight, and store all in readable, immutable snapshots.
4. **Create access masks** — redact, segment, and de-identify sensitive life threads via access logic.

## 🧱 Building Blocks

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CLAM/` | Contextual Layered Archive Model – memory object storage (tweets, notes, files, snapshots). |
| `FARI/` | Field-Aware Relational Interpreter – translates symbolic logic into execution (Python, SQL, narrative). |
| `INTENT/` | Immutable snapshots of current state (`intent_*.json`). Timestamps, emotional tone, realization logs. |
| `THREADS/` | Sequence logs. Raw text chains forming narratives over time. |
| `MASKS/` | Access control & redaction logic – create filters by topic, emotion, sensitivity. |

## 🧠 Sample Use Cases

- Rebuild what I was thinking in **Feb 2023**
- Trace the emergence of **Relational Intelligence**
- Detect mismatched memories or shifted beliefs
- Share parts of my story **without exposing all of it**
- Build a reasoning engine that **learns who I am over time**

## 🔐 Memory as Access

Just because it’s stored doesn’t mean it’s seen.

Memory is permissioned.  
Truth is layered.  
The self is **context-aware**.

## 🚀 Let’s Begin

Welcome to my memory engine.  
This is the first commit of the future version of myself.
